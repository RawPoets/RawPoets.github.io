  The RAW Poets are an art and poetry collective focused on producing original content and media. Through spoken word, art, workshops, and live events, The RAW Poets re-imagine the distinction between artist and patron by creating art you can both interact with, and become a part of. Established in New York City in 2010, the Rebellious Assertive Writers have now expanded their purpose to Atlanta, Chicago, and the District of Colombia.

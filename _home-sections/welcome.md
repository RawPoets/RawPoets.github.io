description: The RAW Poets, a poetry and art collective focuses on producing original
  content and media. Through spoken word, art, workshops, and live events, The RAW
  Poets re-imagine the distinction between artist and patron by creating art you can
  both interact with, and become a part of. Established in New York City in 2010,
  the Rebellious Assertive Writers have now expanded their purpose to Atlanta, Chicago,
  and the District of Colombia.

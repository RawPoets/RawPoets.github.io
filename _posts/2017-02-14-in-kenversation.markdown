RAW Poets [Jeffrey Herrera](http://www.twitter.com/isthatjeff){:target="_blank"} and [Christian Gustavo](http://www.twitter.com/chrisnobody){:target="_blank"} stopped by the [InKenversation w/ Barbie](http://www.twitter.com/InKenversation){:target="_blank"} podcast to discuss love, self-awareness, past relationships, and what it truly means to love yourself. They also performed an on-air rendition of 'A List of the Love We Should Have Given' from the newly released [RAW Love 6](/) project.

## An event brought to you by the good folks at RAW Poets, in conjunction with The Bronx Brewery (because we know you love a side of drink with your feels), we are proud to bring you Home Brewed, a crisp take on art, culture, and food.

Come enjoy a day of **Food Truck Brunch...Food, Live Poetry and Performances, and Freshly Brewed BeerÂ **at the Bronx Brewery with us. Best of all, entry is FREE! All we ask is that you RSVP, be on time, and bring a friend. And your feels. And your appetite.

Performances will begin at 2pm, with the afteparty music being provided by DJ E-Stylez to allow you time to meet your favorite poets and performers, have another round of your favorite food or beer, or just dance on a nice summer Sunday.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact any poet directly, or message @RAWPoets on Twitter/Instagram.

We can't wait to see you there, and as always,

Please drink and #FeelResponsibly

-RAW Poets
